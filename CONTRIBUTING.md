## Code Style and Standards

- Ensure your code follows established coding conventions.
- Maintain clear, readable, and modular code.
- Always test your code before submitting a PR.

## Commit Message Guidelines

Follow these simple rules when writing commit messages:

1. **Use the present tense**: ("Add feature" not "Added feature").
2. **Capitalize the subject line**: Ensure the first letter of the subject line is capitalized.
3. **Keep the subject line concise**: Aim for 50 characters or fewer.
4. **Include a detailed explanation**: If necessary, provide a detailed explanation in the commit body, wrapping lines at 72 characters.
5. **Reference issues and pull requests**: Include references to any related issues or pull requests using `#issue_number`.
6. **Use imperative mood**: Start the message with a verb (e.g., "Fix", "Add", "Update", "Remove").
7. **Separate subject from body with a blank line**: If your message has a body, leave a blank line between the subject and the body.
8. **Be consistent**: Maintain consistency in style and format across your commit messages to improve clarity.

### Common Prefixes

Use the following prefixes to categorize your commits:

- **feat**: A new feature (e.g., `feat: add user login functionality`)
- **fix**: A bug fix (e.g., `fix: resolve issue with product search`)
- **chore**: Routine tasks (e.g., `chore: update dependencies`)
- **docs**: Documentation changes (e.g., `docs: update README with installation instructions`)
- **style**: Formatting changes (e.g., `style: fix whitespace issues`)
- **refactor**: Code changes that neither fix a bug nor add a feature (e.g., `refactor: simplify authentication logic`)
- **test**: Adding or updating tests (e.g., `test: add unit tests for product model`)
